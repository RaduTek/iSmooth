# iSmooth

iSmooth is a HTML/CSS/JS style kit that replicates the old iOS skeuomorphic design (up to iOS 6).

It is designed to be compatible with Safari from iOS 5 and up, so this kit can be used to make web applications for old iOS devices, that match the original aesthetics.

Currently designing and testing for iPad 1 and 2, with an iPhone/iPod Touch friendly version coming later.
